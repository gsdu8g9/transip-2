## Requirements

### Chef version

* When using Chef < `12`, this cookbook will *only* work if you set
  `no_lazy_load` to `true` in your Chef config file. In Chef 12 and up, [this
  configuration is set to `true` by default][no_lazy_load].

* When using `chef-client` < `11.14.0.rc.2`, [cookbook files are downloaded
  sequential][sequential], which is *wicked slow* when using this cookbook, due
  to the included gem sources/binaries. I'd advice upgrading chef-client, or not
  using this cookbook really...

[no_lazy_load]: https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/b75e1de72453e20312dcdc1ea1a480c048ee59a9/RELEASE_NOTES.md#changed-no_lazy_load-config-default-to-true
[sequential]: https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4423

### Platforms

**NOTE** that platform dependencies are strictly enforced. Using this cookbook
on any other platform (version) will abort your Chef run.

* ubuntu 12.04
* ubuntu 14.04
* debian 7.6

### Dependencies

* [transip gem][] by @joost (vendored inside cookbook)

[transip gem]: https://github.com/joost/transip

scope. See the [default][] attribute file for configuration variables and
documentation.

## LRWPs

### transip_dns_entry

#### supports

* `create`
* `create_if_missing`
* `delete`

#### examples

```ruby
transip_dns_entry 'www' do
  action       :create
  domain       'kabisa.nl'
  content      '@'
  type         'CNAME'
  ttl          3600
  username     'kabisa'
  private_key  'your-private-key-here'
  proxy        '192.168.0.1'
  whitelist_ip '33.33.33.100'
end
```

```ruby
default['transip']['username'] = 'kabisa'
default['transip']['private_key'] = 'your-private-key-here'
default['transip']['domain'] = 'kabisa.nl'

transip_dns_entry 'www' do
  action :delete
end
```

some notes:

* all of the above options can have a default set (like
  `node['transip']['whitelist_ip']`) and then be omitted from the above example
* whitelist IPs need to be added in the API backend, and you need to make calls
  from that IP. For this, you can use the proxy option.
* for more details, see the original [transip gem][] by @joost

## compiling gems

All required gems are bundled with the cookbook. Since we require nokogiri, we
have to compile nokogiri for the right platform:

```bash
bin/kitchen converge --concurrency
```

This will compile the gems and add them to `files/<platform>`. See above for
supported platform versions.

Note that the compiled gems are *not* included in the Git repository by default.
You will have to clone the repository and run the above `kitchen` command to get
these gems.
